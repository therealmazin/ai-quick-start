# Prompt Power-Ups

Once you've got the basics, here are some techniques to get even better results.

## 1. Add Role Assignment

Tell the AI to "act as" a specific expert. This changes how it approaches your request.

```
Act as an experienced event planner. Help me design a 3-hour
professional development workshop for faculty. Include: agenda,
activities, and materials needed.
```

**More examples:**
- "Act as a grant writing expert..."
- "Act as a patient technical support specialist..."
- "Act as an academic advisor with 10 years of experience..."

<Callout type="info">
Roles work best when they're relevant to your task. An "event planner" role for event planning, a "writing coach" role for feedback on writing.
</Callout>

---

## 2. Request Multiple Options

Don't settle for the first version. Ask for variations.

```
Give me 3 different versions of this announcement:
one formal, one casual, one creative.

[paste your text]
```

**More examples:**
- "Give me 3 different subject lines for this email: one professional, one creative, one urgent."
- "Create this in two versions: one for students, one for faculty."
- "Suggest 5 different approaches to this problem, ranked by effort required."

---

## 3. Add Constraints for Better Results

Specific constraints lead to better outputs.

```
Create a survey for employee satisfaction. Include exactly
10 questions: 5 multiple choice, 3 rating scale (1-5), and
2 open-ended. Focus on work environment, communication, and
professional development.
```

**Types of constraints:**
- **Quantity:** "exactly 5 bullet points", "10 questions", "3 options"
- **Length:** "under 200 words", "2 paragraphs", "one page"
- **Structure:** "formatted as a table", "numbered list", "Q&A format"
- **Focus:** "focus only on budget", "emphasize timeline", "highlight risks"

---

## 4. Specify Audience Level

The same topic explained differently for different audiences.

```
Explain what a firewall is:
- Version 1: For non-technical staff
- Version 2: For IT-savvy users
- Version 3: For an executive summary
```

**Why it matters:** A technical explanation for non-technical staff will confuse them. A simplified explanation for experts will waste their time.

---

## 5. Ask for Reasoning

When you need to understand the "why", ask for it.

```
I need to schedule 5 committee meetings over 2 months,
avoiding conflicts. Suggest a schedule and explain your
reasoning for the timing.
```

**Other ways to ask:**
- "Explain your thought process"
- "Walk me through your reasoning"
- "Why did you recommend this approach over alternatives?"

---

## 6. Use "More Like This"

When you get something you love, use it as a template.

```
This first paragraph is exactly the tone I want.
Rewrite the rest to match this style.
```

**More examples:**
- "Generate 5 more examples just like this one: [paste example]"
- "This format works perfectly. Create 3 more in the same format for different topics."

## Power-Up Examples by Role

### For Administrative Staff

```
Act as an administrative procedures expert. Review this office
workflow process and suggest 3 improvements for efficiency.
Focus on reducing redundant steps and improving communication.
Format as a before/after comparison.
```

### For Faculty

```
I teach Introduction to Biology to 100 freshmen. Create an
engaging icebreaker activity for the first day that:
- Relates to course content
- Takes 15 minutes
- Requires no materials
- Helps students learn each other's names

Include step-by-step instructions.
```

### For Academic Advisors

```
Create a FAQ document for students about changing majors.
Include:
- 10 common questions
- Clear answers (2-3 sentences each)
- Relevant deadlines
- Who to contact

Tone should be supportive and reassuring.
```

### For Event Coordinators

```
I'm planning a faculty recognition dinner for 75 people.
Budget is $3000. Create:
1. A timeline for the 3-hour event
2. A checklist of tasks by week (starting 6 weeks out)
3. A list of potential issues with mitigation strategies

Format as three separate sections with headers.
```

with case study analysis. [CONTEXT]

Create a scaffolded assignment that builds case analysis skills
over 4 weeks. [GOAL]

Include:
- Weekly objectives
- Assignment descriptions
- Rubric criteria
- Exactly 4 progressive difficulty levels [CONSTRAINTS]

Format as a table with one row per week. [FORMAT]

Also provide 2 alternative approaches and explain why you
recommend your primary suggestion. [MULTIPLE OPTIONS + REASONING]
