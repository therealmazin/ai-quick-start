# Tips & Common Mistakes

Here's what separates okay prompts from great ones.

## Pro Tips

### 1. Have a Conversation, Not a One-Shot Command

Don't expect perfection on the first try. Build on responses.

**Example conversation:**
> **You:** Create an agenda for our staff meeting.
>
> **AI:** [Creates generic agenda]
>
> **You:** Add 15 minutes for team celebrations and move budget discussion to the end.
>
> **AI:** [Updates agenda]
>
> **You:** Perfect. Now add time estimates for each item.

This back-and-forth gets you exactly what you need.

---

### 2. Give Specific Feedback

When the response isn't right, be specific about what to change.

| Don't Say | Do Say |
|-----------|--------|
| "This is not good" | "The tone is too formal, please make it friendlier" |
| "Make it better" | "This is too long. Cut it to 150 words and focus only on action items" |
| "Try again" | "Keep the structure but simplify the language for a non-technical audience" |

---

### 3. Use "More Like This" for Consistency

When something works, use it as a reference.

```
This first paragraph is exactly the tone I want.
Rewrite the rest to match this style.
```

```
Generate 5 more examples just like this one:
[paste your example]
```

---

### 4. Ask for Multiple Options

Don't settle for the first version.

```
Give me 3 different subject lines for this email:
one professional, one creative, one urgent.
```

```
Create this in two versions: one for students, one for faculty.
```

---

### 5. Break Big Tasks into Steps

Instead of asking for everything at once, work through it step by step.

**Too much at once:**
> "Write me a complete training manual for new employees including policies, procedures, benefits, and culture."

**Better approach:**
> "Let's create a new employee training manual. Start with an outline of the main sections we should include."

Then work through each section one at a time.

## Common Mistakes

<Callout type="warn">
These are the most common mistakes that lead to poor AI responses.
</Callout>

### 1. Being Too Vague

**Bad:**
> "Help me with my presentation."

**Good:**
> "Create an outline for a 20-minute presentation on time management for new employees. Include: 3 main strategies, examples, and an interactive element."

---

### 2. Not Iterating

**Bad habit:** Get a result, accept it even if it's not quite right.

**Good habit:** Refine and improve.
> "This is close. Make questions 3-5 more specific and add a rating scale."

---

### 3. Trusting Everything

**Bad habit:** Using AI-generated facts or citations without checking.

**Good habit:** Always verify important details.

<Callout type="warn">
AI can "hallucinate" facts, dates, and citations. Always fact-check statistics, quotes, and research references before using them.
</Callout>

---

### 4. Not Providing Enough Context

**Bad:**
> "Respond to this message."

**Good:**
> "This email is from a frustrated customer. Help me write a calm, helpful response that addresses their concern about shipping delays."

---

### 5. Asking Too Much at Once

**Bad:**
> "Write me a business plan, marketing strategy, budget, and timeline."

**Good:**
> "Let's start with the executive summary of my business plan. I'll share details about my business idea first."

## What AI is Great For

- **Brainstorming & Ideation** - Generate ideas, options, alternatives
- **Drafting & Templates** - First drafts of emails, documents, frameworks
- **Routine Tasks** - Checklists, agendas, summaries, standard communications
- **Explaining & Simplifying** - Breaking down complex topics, creating analogies
- **Formatting & Restructuring** - Organizing information, converting formats

## What to Be Careful With

- **Facts & Citations** - Can hallucinate sources, may provide outdated info
- **Final Decisions** - Use as a tool, not a replacement for your judgment
- **Complex Nuance** - May oversimplify, lacks institutional knowledge
- **Sensitive Information** - Don't input student data, confidential info, or proprietary details
- **Creative/Original Work** - Use as a starting point, not the end product

## Prompt Improvement Checklist

Before you hit enter, ask yourself:

- [ ] **Did I provide context?** Who am I? What's the situation?
- [ ] **Did I include specifics?** Numbers, dates, constraints, audience level?
- [ ] **Did I state my goal clearly?** What exactly do I want?
- [ ] **Did I specify format?** Length, structure, tone?
- [ ] **Did I add any constraints?** What to include or avoid?

If you answered YES to 3-5 of these, you're ready!

## Remember

> The best prompt is the one that **saves you time** and **makes your work better**.

- **Start small** - Pick one task to improve with AI this week
- **Be patient** - Getting good at prompting takes practice
- **Stay curious** - Experiment, play, see what's possible
- **Keep learning** - AI tools evolve, so do your skills
- **Share knowledge** - Help colleagues discover what works
