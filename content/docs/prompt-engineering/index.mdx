# Prompt Engineering Basics

"Prompt engineering" is just a fancy way of saying "how to talk to AI effectively." The better your question or request, the better the AI's response will be.

## Why Does This Matter?

**Vague prompt:**
> "Help me with my email."

**Better prompt:**
> "Write a professional email to my colleague asking to reschedule our meeting from Tuesday to Thursday. Keep it brief and friendly."

The second prompt gives the AI clear direction, so you get a useful response the first time.

## The 5 Golden Rules

### 1. Be Specific

**Instead of:** "Write something about climate change."

**Try:** "Write a 3-paragraph summary of the main causes of climate change, suitable for a university newsletter."

### 2. Give Context

**Instead of:** "Is this good?"

**Try:** "I'm writing a grant proposal for educational technology. Here's my draft introduction. Is it clear and compelling? What could be improved?"

### 3. Specify the Format

**Instead of:** "Tell me about project management."

**Try:** "Give me 5 bullet points on best practices for project management. Keep each point to 1-2 sentences."

### 4. Use Examples When Helpful

**Instead of:** "Write a catchy headline."

**Try:** "Write a catchy headline for our department newsletter. Something like 'Fall Semester Highlights' or 'What's New in Student Services' but more engaging."

### 5. Break Down Complex Tasks

**Instead of:** "Help me plan our annual conference."

**Try:** "I'm planning our department's annual conference. Let's start with the agenda. We need sessions in the morning, a lunch break, and afternoon workshops. Can you suggest a timeline for a one-day event?"

## The RICE Framework

A simple way to structure your prompts:

| Letter | Meaning | Example |
|--------|---------|---------|
| **R** | Role | "Act as an experienced grant writer..." |
| **I** | Instructions | "Write a proposal summary that..." |
| **C** | Context | "This is for a federal education grant..." |
| **E** | Examples | "Similar to this example: [example]" |

### RICE in Action

**Full prompt using RICE:**

> **Role:** You are an experienced academic advisor.
>
> **Instructions:** Help me write a response to a student who is asking about changing their major.
>
> **Context:** The student is a sophomore who wants to switch from Business to Psychology. They're worried about extending their graduation timeline.
>
> **Example:** Keep the tone similar to this: "Thank you for reaching out. Changing majors is a significant decision, and I'm here to help you navigate this process."

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

Avoid these common prompting mistakes:
</Callout>

### Being Too Vague
- Bad: "Make this better."
- Good: "Make this email more concise and professional. Remove unnecessary words."

### Asking Too Much at Once
- Bad: "Write me a business plan, marketing strategy, budget, and timeline."
- Good: "Let's start with the executive summary of my business plan. I'll share details about my business idea first."

### Not Providing Enough Context
- Bad: "Respond to this message."
- Good: "This email is from a frustrated customer. Help me write a calm, helpful response that addresses their concern about shipping delays."

### Expecting Mind-Reading
- Bad: "You know what I mean."
- Good: "To clarify, I want the summary to focus on the budget implications, not the technical details."
