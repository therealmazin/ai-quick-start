# Prompt Basics

"Prompt engineering" sounds fancy, but it's really just **how to ask AI good questions**. The better you ask, the better the answer. Simple as that.

## Why Does This Matter?

**Vague prompt:**
> "Help me with my email."

**Better prompt:**
> "Write a professional email to all staff about the office closure from December 24-26 for the holidays. Keep the tone friendly and include the emergency contact number (555-1234). Keep it under 150 words."

The second prompt gives the AI clear direction, so you get a useful response the first time.

## What Makes a Good Prompt?

Think about these 5 things when writing a prompt:

| Question | Examples |
|----------|----------|
| **Who is it for?** (audience) | All staff, department chairs, new employees |
| **What specifically?** (details) | Dates, numbers, budget, size, timeline |
| **How should it sound?** (tone) | Friendly, professional, casual, formal |
| **How much?** (constraints) | Word count, time limit, number of items |
| **What format?** | Email, checklist, bullet points, numbered list |

You've been doing this naturally! When you ask a colleague for help, you give them context. Same thing here.
