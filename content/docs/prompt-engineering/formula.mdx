# The Perfect Prompt Formula

Once you get the basics, here's a simple formula that works for almost anything:

```
[CONTEXT] + [SPECIFIC INFO] + [GOAL] + [FORMAT]
```

## The 4 Parts Explained

### 1. Context

**Who are you? What's the situation?**

- "I'm an academic advisor..."
- "I work in the registrar's office..."
- "I'm planning a department event..."

### 2. Specific Info

**Topic, audience, constraints, timeline, budget (details)**

- For 50 people
- $1000 budget
- In the spring semester

### 3. Goal

**What do you want?**

- Create an email that...
- Generate 10 ideas for...
- Draft a policy that...

### 4. Format

**How should it look?**

- Format as a numbered list
- Keep it under 200 words
- Create a table with columns for...

## Why This Formula Works

| Part | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **Context** | Tells AI who you are and your situation |
| **Specific Info** | Provides the critical details |
| **Goal** | Makes your desired outcome crystal clear |
| **Format** | Ensures you get it exactly how you need it |

Start with the formula, then customize based on what you get back. It's a conversation, not a one-shot command.
