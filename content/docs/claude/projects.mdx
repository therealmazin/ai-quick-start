# Projects & Custom Instructions in Claude

Claude has a feature called **Projects** that lets you organize your work and give Claude custom instructions. Think of it like creating a dedicated workspace for a specific task or topic.

## What Are Projects?

A Project is like a folder where you can:
- Keep related conversations together
- Upload documents for Claude to reference
- Set custom instructions that apply to all chats in that project

<Callout type="info">
Projects are available on Claude Pro and Team plans. Free users can still use regular chats with Claude.
</Callout>

## Why Use Projects?

**Without Projects:**
Every time you start a new chat, you have to re-explain your context:
> "I'm working on a research project about renewable energy. Here's my document. Please summarize it in an academic tone..."

**With Projects:**
Claude already knows your context:
> "Summarize this document."

Claude remembers your instructions and has access to your uploaded files!

## How to Create a Project

<Steps>
<Step>
**Open Projects**

Look for **"Projects"** in the left sidebar and click it. Or go directly to [claude.ai/projects](https://claude.ai/projects).

<Step>
**Create New Project**

Click **"+ New Project"** in the top-right corner.
</Step>
<Step>
**Name Your Project**

Give your project a clear name (e.g., "Course Materials", "Research Assistant", "Email Helper").

Note: Claude doesn't see the project name, so pick something that helps *you* stay organized.
</Step>
<Step>
**Set Custom Instructions**

Click **"Set Custom Instructions"** and add your preferences (see examples below).
</Step>
<Step>
**Add Project Knowledge (Optional)**

Upload files or documents that Claude should reference across all conversations in this project.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Setting Custom Instructions

Custom instructions tell Claude how to behave in this project. Click "Set Custom Instructions" and add your preferences.

### Example: Email Assistant

```
Role: You are my professional email assistant.

Style:
- Write emails that are professional but friendly
- Keep emails concise (3-4 paragraphs max)
- Use clear subject lines
- Always end with an appropriate sign-off

Format:
- Present emails ready to copy-paste
- If I just give you bullet points, turn them into a polished email
```

### Example: Research Helper

```
Role: You are my research assistant.

Context: I work in [your field] and need help analyzing academic papers.

Style:
- Use clear, academic language
- Cite sources when relevant
- Present information in a structured way

Format:
- Use headings and bullet points
- Summarize key findings first, then provide details
- Flag any limitations or caveats
```

### Example: Simple Helper

```
I'm new to using AI assistants.

Please:
- Use simple, everyday language
- Avoid technical jargon
- Explain things step by step
- Ask me if something is unclear
```

## Adding Project Knowledge

You can upload files to your project's "Knowledge" section. Claude will reference these files in all conversations within that project.

**Supported file types:**
- PDF documents
- Word documents (.docx)
- Text files (.txt)
- HTML files
- Spreadsheets (.csv)
- Code files

**How to add files:**
1. In your project, look for the **Knowledge** section (usually on the right side)
2. Click the **+** button
3. Upload your files or paste text

<Callout type="info">
You can upload multiple files, but the total content must fit within Claude's context limit (about 500 pages worth of text).
</Callout>

## Tips for Using Projects

### Keep Projects Focused
One project = one purpose. Create separate projects for different tasks:
- "Meeting Notes Summarizer"
- "Course Material Helper"
- "Email Drafting"

### Update Knowledge Regularly
If your reference documents change, update them in the project knowledge section.

### Save Useful Outputs
If Claude creates something useful (like a template or summary), you can add it to your project knowledge for future reference.

## Free Users: Custom Instructions Without Projects

If you're on the free plan, you can still give Claude instructions at the start of each conversation:

> "For this conversation, please act as my writing assistant. Keep responses concise and use bullet points. I work in education and prefer a professional but friendly tone."

You'll need to repeat this for each new chat, but it works well for occasional use.
