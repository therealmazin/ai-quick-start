# Protect Your Privacy in ChatGPT

By default, ChatGPT may use your conversations to train and improve its AI models. If you want to keep your chats private, you should turn this off.

We recommend turning off data training, especially if you discuss sensitive or work-related topics.

## What Happens When You Turn It Off?

- Your conversations will **not** be used to train OpenAI's models
- Your chat history will still be saved (you can still see your past conversations)
- The setting applies to your entire account, on all devices
- You only need to do this once

## Extra Privacy Tips

### Use Temporary Chats

For extra-sensitive conversations, use **Temporary Chat** mode:
1. Click the dropdown arrow next to "ChatGPT" at the top
2. Select **Temporary Chat**
3. These chats are not saved to your history and are never used for training

### Business and Enterprise Users

If your organization uses **ChatGPT Enterprise** or **ChatGPT Business**, your data is automatically protected. Your conversations are never used for training.

## Summary

| Setting | What to do |
